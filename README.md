# Angular-Goole-Map Details

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.

Project description:
I created responsive Angular web application 
In this project, I used bootstrap to design some parts and I used Google Map and AGM to use Google Map

In Google Map, the company's location is displayed with a different icon from the customer icon
And the company's location is fixed and non-drag and drop
Customers' locations can be changed and dragged
When you click on the icon of each customer, the details of that customer are displayed
And the location of the vehicle can be changed and dragged

In the right part and wing of the app, you can select your vehicle, which changes its icon in the map by changing the vehicle
On the right side of the app there is a list of customers and their locations
When we change the customer icon in the map, their location in the list on the right also changes

As well as a list of packages has arrived that are empty by default
When you drag the vehicle icon onto the customer icon by dragging the name and label of that customer are added to the arrived package list
And the customer label and name in the customer list changes to Package Arrived


## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
